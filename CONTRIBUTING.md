The WebUI is under active development—your help is invaluable! Here’s how you can get involved:

1. **Test features**
   - Test installation setup.  
   - Try out preprocessing (images, video, Polycam, Record3D, ODM).  
   - Experiment with the training tab (Splat/NeRF training).  
   - Explore Viser launch and model export flows as they come online.

2. **Report issues**  
   - If something doesn’t work as expected, please open a GitHub issue.  
   - Include steps to reproduce, any error messages, and your OS/Python version.

3. **Suggest improvements**  
   - Propose enhancements to the UI, workflows, or documentation.  
   - Share BDD scenarios or example datasets that illustrate real-world use cases.
